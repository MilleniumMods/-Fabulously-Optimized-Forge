# ![Fabulously Optimized Forge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46550675/219758500-78c177fa-745b-4337-b30a-159072b50c95.png) Fabulously Optimized, but Forge
A Forge-based Minecraft modpack focusing on performance and graphics enhancements - Based off the original Fabulously Optimized for Fabric.

**I'm currently looking for people to help developing and testing these modpacks. Any contribution is appreciated!**

# Why remake this for Forge?
Even though, in recent years, Fabric has seen the biggest contributions regarding optimizations for modded scenarios, there's still a pretty large amount of players that use Forge. These modpacks are for them.

The idea of these modpacks is not to replace all Forge packs. Hopefully, this will work as an addition for already-existing modpacks and Vanilla players, so once you download the mods available in here, you can just drop them onto your main mods folder, and see significant performance improvements, or if you're just a Vanilla player, install one of these packs, and see major improvements over just Vanilla/Optifine.

# Why support 1.12.2 & 1.16.5?
Ironically, the people that most need these kind of packs are also the ones less likely to be able to use them. Modern Minecraft can be insanely heavy for low-end devices, and even when using a ton of optimization mods, there are still lots of people unable to play Minecraft correctly past 1.16.5 (And in some cases, even struggle past 1.12.2).

# Disclaimers
1. Even tho I do support Forge, I highly encourage switching to Fabric when it's applicable for your use case.
2. I'll try my best to support Forge 1.12.2 & 1.16.5, but since these versions are no longer supported by most mod authors (And by the Forge team themselves), many features and optimizations of the modpack in newer versions may be missing.
3. The fact that different versions are supported doesn't mean that the pack itself will be any similar between Minecraft versions. I'll try to bring as much feature-parity as possible, but since the main purpose of this modpack is to optimize your game, if there are any features that have to be replaced/completely removed in order to bring performance improvements, I won't hesitate to prioritize better performance.
4. In order to bring as many features or optimizations as possible, some of the packs may use incomplete/unstable versions of some mods.
5. This is not a direct fork of [Fabulously Optimized for Fabric](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) nor is officially supported by its author. If you have any issues while using one of the Fabulously Optimized **for Forge** modpacks, please make an issue request in this repository.
